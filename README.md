# SAML SSO App Lists
This is an open source project to identify every app in the world that supports SAML. If an app supports SAML, it should be possible to integrate with **any** Identity Provider for secure Single Sign-On (SSO). Identity providers include organizations like OneLogin, Okta, Ping, Microsoft, Google, KeyCloak, Gluu, etc.
